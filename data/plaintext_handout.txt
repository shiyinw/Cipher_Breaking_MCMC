for reference a typical wellengineered decoder you might submit should converge accurately within at most a few minutes. nevertheless we will allow each student submission up to hour of run time to avoid unduly penalizing inefficient but otherwise good implementations. this is the time allotted per student to start the program and call the function for all of the ciphertexts one at a time. hence if your decoder doesnt have a built in stopping criterion it will terminate after an hour and the deciphered text in the output file or files if some ciphertexts have finished at that point will be used.
